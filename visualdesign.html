	  <br> <p>I started by creating my character, I brainstormed how I wanted my character to look. 
My character looks like a motocross player. She is wearing her motorcycle helmet and gear and is on a dirtbike. My character would most likely be in a racing game anywhere where she can show off her motor skills. Their purpose in the game is to show how a girl can be just as good as a boy “in their own sport” (basically a girl can beat a boy, in a boys sport).

	  <br> <p>I started by finding pictures that described me. Some pictures I used were my own, that I thought should be in my collage because of the comfort the photos give me. I included an inspirational picture in my collage because it’s my daily affirmation. These pictures all have a deeper meaning to me and explains how I am as a person. I think my collage matched my aesthetic because it's so simple with so much meaning, which is something I go for all the time.
